# Steady State Conduction Problem
Steady state conduction problem: Solving the steady state conduction problem for three different cases using three different methods. The methods used are incomplete LU decomposition(ILU), strongly implicit procedure(SIP) and conjugate gradient method. The results are plotted and compared with the analytical solution for validation.
