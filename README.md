# CFD Lid Driven Cavity Problem plots.
Lid driven cavity: Implementation of Marker and Cell algorithm to solve 2D lid driven cavity problem. The stream function contour, pressure contour, u-velocity contour and v-velocity contour data are obtained and plotted using Tecplot. To validate the solution, the u- velocity variation along the mid vertical line and the v velocity variation along the mid horizontal line are compared with those of Ghia et al. (1982) paper.
